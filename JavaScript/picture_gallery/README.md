The following files have functionality of an image gallery iterating in an infinite loop. The gallery can be paused at any image with pause button, it can display any of the images at any time (by clicking at appropriate dot), it can go back to previous image or go to the next one with left or right pointing arrow buttons. Each button except for the pause button is visible only when the user hovers the mouse cursor over the images.
