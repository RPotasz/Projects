In this directory one can find 3D models of a vehicle propelled by two driving wheels. To keep it stable, each corner is supported by an aluminum sphere with a diameter of 10mm. The motion is caused thanks to two stepper motors, located at the sides of the device's chassis. The model was compact, allowing for quick corrections and replacements of unfitting or broken elements. Models of the electronics used in the project were prepared for the purpose of estimation of dimensions required, hence their details could be omitted. The unit's goal was to reach predefined spot on prepared gird-like maze, by following instructions sent by a PC.
